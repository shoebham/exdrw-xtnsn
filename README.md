# Excalidraw to extension

I got bored looking at the usual new tab screen and wanted it to be a space where I can actually see things I want to see like my pending tasks.
So I generated this extension with claude sonnet. I didn't write a single piece of code for this. Works pretty well. Amazing!

if you want to use it locally, just 
- Clone this 
- Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.
- Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
- Click "Load unpacked" and select the directory containing your extension files.
